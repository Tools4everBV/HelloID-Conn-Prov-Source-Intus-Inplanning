## Introduction

_HelloID-Conn-Prov-Source-Intus-Inplanning_ is a _source_ connector. The purpose of this connector is to import _humanresources_ and their _resourceRoster_. A resourceRoster represents a timetable consisting of days and parts which include work places.

### Endpoints

Currently the following endpoints are being used..

| Endpoint                  | Description                                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| api/token                 |                                                       |
| api/users                 | Default endpoint to get all users                     |
| api/humanresources        | Optional endpoint to receive employees without a user |
| api/resourcegroups        | To calculate upper department                         |
| api/roster/resourceRoster |                                                       |

| BaseUrl        | The URL to the API                                                                                                                                                                               | Yes       |
| HistoricalDays | - The number of days in the past from which the shifts will be imported.<br> - Will be converted to a `[DateTime]` object containing the _current date_ __minus__ the number of days specified.  | Yes       |
| FutureDays     | - The number of days in the future from which the shifts will be imported.<br> - Will be converted to a `[DateTime]` object containing the _current date_ __plus__ the number of days specified. | Yes       |

### Remarks

- This is not a complete source connector that creates a person in HelloID with a full dataset of personal data. This is a source connector that creates a small person object with contracts from the shifts in Inplanning. Through aggregation, the Inplanning "person" can be aggregated with the person created by the HR source system. We perform the aggregation based on the externalID.

- We filter out absences to avoid creating contracts and granting permissions in target systems based on shifts that will not take place.

- Diacritical marks do not come through correctly in HelloID when the connector is run on-premises. Therefore, it is preferable not to enable that toggle.
#### Logic in-depth

The purpose of this connector is to import _humanresources_ and their _resourceRoster_. A resource roster consists of days which include parts. each part represents a shift with a start and end time. Each part will result in a contract in HelloID

All workers are imported and then the days will be imported within a specified timeframe, configured by the `HistoricalDays` and `FutureDays` settings in the configuration.

Each _plannedWorker_ typically has multiple shifts (usually one per day, but can be up to three), we selectively import shifts as contracts from within the defined time frame.

Only persons who have active shifts in the timeframe defined by `HistoricalDays` and `FutureDays` will be created in HelloID.
